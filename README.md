## Download
- You can either download the `.jar`-file from newest release, if you just want to play the game. 
- The source code can be downloaded in several versions: 
    - the latest full release (watch at the right side for the `Releases`, that is the newest)
    - the latest early access-preview (`Releases` --> `X tags` --> click the latest release)
    - any current branch (`master` is the main branch, there might be some more feature branches --> Download source code)

## Run
- For your Java-Installation, it might work just fine if you double-click the file. 
- If this does not work, run `java -jar PATH_TO_JAR.jar` in the terminal. 

### Find `.jar`-file
- Source code: The .jar-file can be found in the `out/`-directory. Then follow the steps above. 
- You might also have downloaded only the `.jar`-file
